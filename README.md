## Description

I wanted to build this application to test my new skills with mysql, RESTful API's, and just back-end development work in general. This application is fully functional, as you can test every single route available in the database on Insomnia or another REST Client, and you can use it for your E-commerce needs.

## Installation

The first thing you'll want to do is clone the repository onto your local machine by typing `git clone git@github.com:NickLoeffler999/note-taker.git` into your CLI. Once you've done that, open the file in your favorite code editor, and open up a terminal once again. Install the needed dependencies by typing `npm i` in your CLI and then hit enter. After the packages are installed, go ahead and log into mysql, and then type `SOURCE db/schema.sql` to initialize the database we want to work with. `USE ecommerce_db` is the next command you'll want to enter in before quitting mysql. Once you're out of mysql, seed the database by running `npm run seed` in your command line, and then finally `node server.js`. Open up Insomnia or an application similar, and follow the routes to make your own E-commerce database!
